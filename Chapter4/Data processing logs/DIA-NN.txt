Thread number set to 12
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
Protein inference will not be performed
Number of interference removal iterations set to 0
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1e-05 (MS2) and 2e-05 (MS1)
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:1 
Unless the spectral library specified was created by this version of DIA-NN, it's strongly recommended to specify a FASTA database and use the 'Reannotate' function to allow DIA-NN to identify peptides which can originate from the N/C terminus of the protein: otherwise site localisation might not work properly for modifications of the protein N-terminus or for modifications which do not allow enzymatic cleavage after the modified residue
